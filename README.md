Repository for NLP final project. We use pretrained model ESM-1b and explor various aspects of proteins through the model.

daniel.ipynb contains code for the masked language model task and exploring likelihoods of different amino acids across species

cluster_properties.ipynb contains code for the clustering and dimensional reduction of Human protein embeddings

featureprediction.ipynb contains code for linear regression on embedding space

generate_embeddings.py is a script for generating embeddings for human protein sequences from ESM-1b

run_masking.py is a script that generated data for the masked language model task

utilities.py contains useful functions
